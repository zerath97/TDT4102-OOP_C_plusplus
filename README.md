- Generating random numbers
- Cannonball (game) using pseudo-random numbers
## Exercise 4: 
- Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference
- Struct
- String and dealing with chars
- Creating a complete simple game (Mastermind game).
- Graphics using FLTK (Mastermind game)
## Exercise 5:
- Conventions for classes
- Enums
